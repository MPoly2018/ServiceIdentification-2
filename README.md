# ServiceIdentification-2

**ServiceMiner** is a static-analysis-based service identification tool that supports the migration of legacy Java-based enterprise systems toward a **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)**. It automatically discovers and categorizes service candidates according to their types such as **Entity**, **Utility**, and **Application services**â€”to aid architects and developers during the early stages of system migration.
